    <p>
     My development journey began in 2017.  I had spent nearly 12 years as a Creative Director in the non-profit sector.  While I loved what I was doing I was hungry for a new challenge and had always been fascinated by how things work on the web. <br><br>

     So after more than a decade as a Creative Director I walked away and began my develpoment journey.  I initially began with some Udemy courses. In 2017 I attended DevMountain's immersive web development bootcamp fulltime. My experience was both frustrating and rewarding.  Frustrating because everything was new to me.  I had no prior coding experience. Things seemed to take longer to click for me, and I found myself batteling insecurities on a daily basis.  Rewarding beacause I love learning and creating things.  The satisfaction of figuring things out and solving probems was addictive.<br><br>

     In addition to being a creative I'm also a vocalist and musician, playing both piano and guitar.  I love all things design and am obssed with creating amazing experiences.

    <u><h3>Healthy Living</h3></u>
    <p>This project was built for a client using React. The project takes advantage of React's Component based architecture and renders both statefull Class based components and stateless Functional components. One cool element is the connection to the Google API that renders live news specific to this clients business. The design layout uses both CSS FlexBox and Grid.</p>

    <u><h3>Breast Connections</h3></u>
    <p>This project built in React was part of my group project at DevMountain. The idea was inspired by one of our team mates mother that is a breast cancer survivor.  The goal was to provide a user based application for cancer survivors and those still fighting cancer to find support and other resources more easily. The project uses B-Crypt for authentication. Users can create posts and post them in a variety of forums. Users can like other users posts, as well as direct message other users. Users can perform live searches for Doctors and other resources through the Google API which returns images and maps for each result. It contains an express server and a database built with sqltabs and hosted on Heroku. The design layout includes CSS FlexBox and Grid as well as the library from Ant-d.
