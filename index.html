    <p>
      My development journey began in 2017. I had spent nearly 12 years as a Creative Director in the non-profit sector. While
      I loved what I was doing I was hungry for a new challenge and had always been fascinated by how software and apps work
      under the hood.
      <br>
      <br> So after more than a decade as a Creative Director I walked away and began my develpoment journey. I initially began
      with some Udemy courses. In 2017 I attended DevMountain's immersive web development bootcamp fulltime. My experience
      was both frustrating and rewarding. Frustrating because everything was new to me. I had no prior coding experience.
      Things seemed to take longer to click for me, and I found myself battling insecurities on a daily basis. Rewarding
      beacause I love learning and creating things. The satisfaction of figuring things out and solving probems was addictive.
      <br>
      <br> In addition to being a
      <u>"Creative",</u> I'm also a vocalist and musician, playing both piano and guitar. I love all things design and am obsessed
      with creating amazing experiences.

      <h3>Healthy Living</h3>
    </u>
    <p>This project was built for a client using React. The project takes advantage of React's Component based architecture
      and renders both statefull Class based components and stateless Functional components. One cool element is the connection
      to the Google API that renders live news specific to this clients business. The design layout uses both CSS FlexBox
      and Grid. Here is the link to the github repository.

      <h3>Breast Connections</h3>
    </u>
    <p>This project built in React is a full CRUD application and was part of my group project at DevMountain. The idea was
      inspired by one of our teammates mother that is a breast cancer survivor. The goal was to provide a user based application
      for cancer survivors and those still fighting cancer to find support and other resources more easily.
      <br></br>
      The project uses B-Crypt for authentication. Users can create posts and post them in a variety of forums. Users can like
      other users posts, as well as direct message other users. Users can perform live searches for Doctors and other resources
      through the Google API which returns images and maps for each result. Users can also write reviews on the returning
      data. Breast Connections contains an express server and a database built with MYsql and hosted on Heroku. The design
      layout uses reusable design components that pass props as well as CSS FlexBox and Grid. We also took advantage of the
      awesome React based design library from Ant-d. Here is the link to the github repository.
